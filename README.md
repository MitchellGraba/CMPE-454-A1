novel feature 1:The explosions created when a missile hits its destination will explode and then contract to make for a more realistic looking explosion animation. This is done by using two states for the explosions. At first they are in an expanding state, which lasts until until the maximum radius is achieved. Then it switches to a contracting state where it will contract until it reaches a negative radius. When the radius is negative, the explosion is removed altogether.

novel feature 2:The missiles have a fade to them that makes them look like they have motion. The fade is achieved by layering three coloured lines on top of each other and moving the tail point after a certain distance from the tip to the tail is achieved. The three layered lines change in colour, getting closer to black which creates the fade effect.
